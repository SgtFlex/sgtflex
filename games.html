      <p>"Sacrilege" is a multiplayer FPS/RTS-hybrid sandbox game set in the "Halo" universe in which your team works together to survive an endless onslaught of enemies that increase in difficulty. All players have the ability to switch to a "Commander" mode at any time, which is a dual-function mode that allows players to buy things from a shop to aid them in battle, as well as give commands to AI.
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>"Sacrilege" was created from scratch using Unreal Engine 4/5, including all of the characters (which can be found in the 'Art' section), as well as a lot of different systems such as health, physics, vehicles, characters, and interactions between the various systems to allow for these to trigger each other (such as grenades triggering other grenades, vehicles causing collision damage to explosive barrels, etc). All present weapon models were created by various artists credited on the main menu under "Attributions".</p>
      <h2>In Depth AI Behaviors</h2>
      <img class="game" src="media/b0OEYOw.jpeg">  
      <p>The AI of Sacrilege have expansive behiavior trees which allow them to react to the environment around them quickly. They react to stimuli in the environment, commandeer nearby vehicles, and react to commands given to them by their commander (which includes the player). Every character and vehicle each have their own AI to allow for different reactions and capabilities.</p>
      <h2>The RTS component</h2>
      <img class="game" src="media/HaloFloodFanGame01_MzSKvIZ4jn.jpg"> 
      <p>Sacrilege is a hybrid FPS/RTS, which means you primarily play in a first-person perspective shooting down foes, but you also have the ability to switch to a commander mode on the fly which allows you to call down troops, place traps, and give commands.</p>

      <h1 style="padding-top: 300px;">Garry's Mod Halo SPV3</h1>
      <p>With a group of collaborators, we ported content from a mod called "Halo SPV3" into "Garry's Mod" (which is a sandbox game on steam using Half Life 2 as a skeleton and utilizes Lua as a programming language for modders), while also creating original assets for the mod. We created the shaders and programmed the characters to function similar to how they did in SPV3. </p>

      <p>Over the course of some months, I worked to port over a faction of characters from "Halo" (using existing tools) and programmed their behaviors, which include flying, lasering, and death behaviors.</p>
